# Robotics-course
#       To start off the obstacle course we started with three tiny, small bumps. Next there is a 180Â° turn into the 2 blue bumps then after that we have just a basic green bump. But here's when it starts to get a little more complicated with a side-by-side ramp. To finish it off the black bump which is one big bump with a small bump at the end. Base Bot get through the the first 3 obstacles with no issues but when we get to the side-by-side ramps it got a little harder to solve this we just increase the speed and if it was align that perfectly it could easily get over. Then the last one was very easy as the small bump did not affect it. The biggest challenge that we faced was using the double ramps because the double ramps were very hard to get over. And the three small bumps worked best because they were small but the green pump which is slightly bigger and longer also worked well.
